DELTA_T FOR PY 43.56484939009212e-15
DELTA_T FOR CoPt 4.37971952535595e-15

These values of delta_t ensure computational timestep is 0.01 (but must be
changed if the cell size changes)

[1]Size of time discretization Delta-t in [s]

[2]Total number of steps for dynamics, STEPS (total time is STEPS * Delta-t)

[3]Seed for random number generators, must be a very large integer (long long specifically)

[4]Temperature for stochastical Langevin dynamics (0 for deterministic), in [K]

[5]Number of steps between each writing of .xyz trajectory files, integer

[6]Number of steps between each writing of .dat magnetization and energy files, integer

[7]Gilbert Damping constant alpha

[8]Micromagnetic exchange tensor A (always diagonal for this program)

[9]External Field X Y Z components (amplitude of pulse, in [T])

[10]Lattice parameter of finite difference cell, simple cubic lattice only,[nm]

[11]Saturation Magnetization (SI units)

[12]Steps between writing of partial data (deprecated!)

[13]Choose 0 if fresh simulation, choose 1 if restarting from partially saved
data(deprecated!)

[14]Choose integrator to solve dynamical equations
	0 - RK4 + Adams-Bashfort-Moulton PC: 4th order precision, slow, only for T = 0
K, may blow up
	1 - Spherical Euler Predictor-Corrector (explicit spherical): 2nd order precision, fastest,
symplectic
	2 - Heun's Method (Euler Predictor + Trapezoidal Corrector): 2nd order precision, moderate speed, temperatures away from Curie
point

[15]Number Z of steps to turn off the Zeeman field B (restart simulation or use thermalized result to apply field!), number of relaxation steps is (STEPS - Z)

[16]Choose 2 for XY model, choose 3 for a tridimensional system (P.S
skyrmions are a 3D system!)

[17]Block and Thread sizes for CUDA kernels: must be a power of 2, ideal is 256x256 for most cases

[18]Choose 0 for constant in time external field, choose 1 for periodic in time field

[19]Choose frequency of periodic field in [s^-1]

[20]Choose 0 for deterministic LLG dynamics at T=0 and choose 1 for Langevin dynamics at T>0

[21]Direction of uniaxial and uniform anisotropic field (don't worry about unitary vectors!)

[22]Intensity of uniaxial and uniform magnetocrystalline anisotropy (SI
units)

[23] Intensity of DM superficial Field, D (choose both values equal if
monolayer)

[24] L1 and L2, values of distance from z_min where DM interaction decays to
D1 and D2 respectively, i.e if L1 = 1, L2 = 2, we will have D1 in z =
[0,1] and D2 in z = [1, 2] with D=0 above z=2

[25] Ratio J'/J of magnetic impurity (only pointwise impurities supported in
this version)

[26] Current Density to be applied on the x-axis (SI units)

[27] Choose whether or not current density is periodic in time (0 for not, 1 for yes)

[28] Choose frequency of periodic current (only one direction for now) in s^-1 

[29] Adiabatic Torque Transfer parameter Beta

[30] Number of steps to turn off the current density

[31] Mean percentage of polarization of angular moments in the current density - ( P )

[32] Choose curvature of uniaxial anisotropy: 1 -> flat surface (refer to
line 21 for direction), 2 -> cylindrical such that H_anisotropy ~ - (m . (0,
cos t, sin t) ), 3 -> spherical such that H_anisotropy ~ - (m . (cos t sin
phi, sin t sin phi, cos phi) )
